# SEA-ViT: Sea Surface Currents Forecasting 🌊🚀

## Overview

Predicting sea surface currents is crucial for various applications, including maritime navigation, environmental monitoring, and climate analysis. This is especially important in regions like the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. 🌏

Introducing **SEA-ViT** — an advanced deep learning model developed by **Teerapong Panboonyuen** that combines the Vision Transformer (ViT) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). 🌟 This innovative architecture captures spatio-temporal covariance to accurately forecast sea surface currents (U, V) using high-frequency radar (HF) data. 📡

### Why SEA-ViT? 🤔

The name **SEA-ViT** stands for *Sea Surface Currents Forecasting using Vision Transformer*. It emphasizes our model’s focus on ocean dynamics and its utilization of the ViT architecture to boost forecasting accuracy. 🌊🔮

**SEA-ViT** excels at uncovering complex dependencies by leveraging an extensive dataset spanning over 30 years. It incorporates ENSO indices (El Niño, La Niña, and neutral phases) to tackle the intricate interplay between geographic coordinates and climatic variations. 🌡️🌐

### Key Features ✨

- **High-Precision Forecasting:** Utilizes cutting-edge ViT and GRU technologies for accurate sea surface current predictions.
- **Long-Term Data Integration:** Trained on a rich 30-year dataset, including crucial ENSO indices.
- **Supports GISTDA:** Enhances predictive capabilities for Thailand’s maritime regions.
